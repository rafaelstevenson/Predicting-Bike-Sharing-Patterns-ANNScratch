# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-ANNScratch

This is one of the projects in the udacity deep learning nanodegree 
where we construct our own neural network from scratch using numpy 
and predict bike sharing rides, so a bike rental company could 
predict how many bikes do they need to have. 

because if the company have too few bikes they could lose potential customers, 
but if the bikes are too many the company would just waste money as the bike is just sitting around unused.

The ArtificialNN.py file is the neural network class where there are feed forward and backpropagation
implemented using numpy and the Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Pattern notebook is using the constructed Neural Network
to predict the Bike Sharing Pattern Case.

Feel free to check it out, to try to understand how basic Neural Network works and play around with 
the parameters.

The requirement.txt lists required packages for the whole udacity's deep learning nanodegree, for this
project only pandas and numpy is needed.
